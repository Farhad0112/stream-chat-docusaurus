A UI component for conditionally displaying a `Thread` or `Channel`.
It's also possible to display the `Thread` side by side with the `Channel`. It's a very minimal component that might fit some use cases, and if not, is easy to modify and rewrite.

## Basic Usage

The `Window` component must wrap the main channel components to enable mount and unmount behavior, and the `Thread` component should also be on the same level. This ensures correct width changes in the main channel when opening and closing a `Thread`.

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <Chat client={chatClient}>
    <Channel>
      <Window>
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Window>
      <Thread />
    </Channel>
  </Chat>
);
```

## Props
