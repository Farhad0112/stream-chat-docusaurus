Utilizing the Stream Chat API, the Stream Chat React SDK component library includes everything you need to build feature-rich and high functioning chat user experiences right out of the box while also providing many opportunities for customization.
Use cases include team and social messaging, livestream event, livestream gaming, and customer support. The SDK supports rich media messages, reactions, threads, / commands (for giphy and more), image uploads, videos, read state, and typing indicators, to name a few.

A common pattern in the library is via the use of context providers (see [Contexts](./contexts/chat_context)) that allows effective value and function sharing between parent and their children.
This makes customization very straightforward because you can use our exported context providers and hooks in your custom component and receive the exact values needed while also subscribing to context changes.

The left navigation will guide you to the various documentation sections for information on everything regarding our robust SDK. Check out the below instructions for installing Stream Chat React and the necessary dependencies.
