Here's a high level overview of SDK setup and the core components and how they fit together. It's a great starting point, and you can follow along in your code editor though it's not completely exhaustive in terms setting up a React project or instructions on creating specific files.
For a step-by-step guide in that sense, see: https://getstream.io/chat/react-chat/tutorial/

## Your First App with Stream Chat React

Before starting, make sure you have installed `stream-chat-react` (and `stream-chat`) as directed in the [Installation](./installation.mdx) section.

Below is the few lines of JSX code required for a fully functioning chat experience. The `Chat` and `Channel` components are React context providers that pass a variety of values to their children including UI components, channel state data, and messaging functions.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <Chat client={chatClient}>
    <Channel channel={channel}>
      <Window>
        <ChannelHeader />
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Window>
      <Thread />
    </Channel>
  </Chat>
);
```

## Creating a Chat Client

To interact with Stream's chat services you must get an instance of Stream Chat to inject into the `Chat` component, and for this you will need an api key. To create one you can sign up for a [free 30-day trial](https://getstream.io/chat/trial/). Initialize a chatClient:

```jsx
import { StreamChat } from 'stream-chat';

const chatClient = StreamChat.getInstance('api_key');

<Chat client={chatClient}>// UI Components</Chat>;
```

## Connecting a User

Tokens are used to authenticate a user. Typically, you send this token from your backend to the client when a user registers or logs in. See the [Tokens & Authentication](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/tokens_and_authentication/) documentation to
learn more about creating tokens. For our purposes here, we will assume you have created and retrieved a `userToken`.

To connect a user, the `connectUser` function on your client instance should be called and provided with the user object and `userToken`.
Connecting a user could be done in the login flow or elsewhere in the application after the client is instantiated. Once a user is connected, you can interact with the backend effectively.

```jsx
chatClient.connectUser(
  {
    id: 'dave-matthews',
    name: 'Dave Matthews',
  },
  userToken,
);
```

## Creating a Channel

Channels are at the core of Stream Chat; they are where messages are contained, sent, and interacted with. Letâ€™s initialize a channel to inject into the `Channel` component.

A [channel type](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/react/channel_features/) is required when creating a channel and dictates the features and permissions available for a given channel.
There are 5 default types of channels.

- `livestream`
- `messaging`
- `team`
- `gaming`
- `commerce`

These options provide you with sensible defaults for the named use cases. You can also define custom channel types.

The first two arguments to create a channel via the channel method on our client instance are the channel type and the channel id.
A channel must be initialized with either an id or a list of members for the channel. If you provide a list of members an id will be auto-generated on backend for the channel.

```jsx
const channel = chatClient.channel('messaging', {
  // add as many custom fields as you'd like
  name: 'Creating a Messaging Channel',
  members: ['dave-matthews'],
});
```

or

```jsx
const channel = chatClient.channel('messaging', 'dave-matthews-channel-id', {
  // add as many custom fields as you'd like
  name: 'Creating a Messaging Channel',
});
```

## Setting Up the UI Components

Now that we have a client instance, a connected user, and a channel created on the server, it's time to look at the core UI components involved in a fully functioning chat application.

### Chat

The `Chat` component is a React context provider that wraps the entire application, and it must be utilized to ensure that the UI functions properly. Its children consume the `ChatContext`, which includes the instance of the Stream Chat client that we initialized above. It's accessible via the provided hook.
Find more information about the Chat component on the [docs page](../core-components/chat.mdx).

```ts
const { client } = useChatContext();
```

### Channel

The Channel component is another React context provider that passes relevant channel data to its children via four separate contexts. Each context must be imported into your project individually.

- `ChannelStateContext`
- `ChannelActionContext`
- `ComponentContext`
- `TypingContext`

Find more information for this component, including a list of props, on the [docs page](../core-components/channel.mdx).

### ChannelList

The `ChannelList` component renders a list of channels and provides a preview of each. We've added the `ChannelList` to this core component list here, but you'll notice we didn't actually include it in the initial JSX code snippet at the top of the page.
The use of this component is optional, and if used then you shouldn't include the channel prop on `Channel` as the `ChannelList` takes care of the necessary functionality. Insert this component into the code like this:

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <Chat client={chatClient}>
    <ChannelList />
    <Channel>
      <Window>
        <ChannelHeader />
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Window>
      <Thread />
    </Channel>
  </Chat>
);
```

Find more information for this component, including a list of filtering and sort props (which adjusts the query), on the [docs page](../core-components/channel-list.mdx).

### Window

The `Window` component conditionally displays a `Thread` or `Channel`. It's also possible to display the `Thread`side by side with the`Channel`. See the component [docs page](../utility-components/window.mdx) for more information.

### ChannelHeader

The `ChannelHeader` displays pertinent information regarding the currently active channel, including image and title. See the component [docs page](../utility-components/channel-header.mdx) for more information.

### MessageList

The `MessageList` component renders a list of messages and is a consumer of the various contexts from `Channel`. This component accepts a wide variety of optional props for optimal customization.
See the component [docs page](../core-components/message-list.mdx) for more information.

### Thread

The `Thread` component enables your application to support threaded replies on a parent message. Within this component, you can customize its message list and text input.
See the component [docs page](../core-components/thread.mdx) for more information.

### MessageInput

The `MessageInput` component is an HTML input with additional, built-in functionality like image and video uploads, emoji picker, and command support for giphy and mentioned users.
See the component [docs page](../message-input-components/message-input.mdx) for more information.

## Summary

In addition to the above referenced UI components, client instantiation, and user connection, you will need little other code to get a fully functioning chat application up and running. See below for an example of the complete code.

```ts
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { ChannelSort, StreamChat } from 'stream-chat';
import {
  Chat,
  Channel,
  ChannelHeader,
  ChannelList,
  MessageList,
  MessageInput,
  Thread,
  Window,
} from 'stream-chat-react';
import 'stream-chat-react/dist/css/index.css';

const apiKey = StreamChat.getInstance('api_key');

const filters = { type: 'messaging' };
const options = { state: true, presence: true, limit: 10 };
const sort: ChannelSort = { last_message_at: -1, updated_at: -1 };

const chatClient = StreamChat.getInstance(apiKey);

const App = () => {
  const [clientReady, setClientReady] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const setupClient = async () => {
      try {
        await chatClient.connectUser(
          {
            id: 'dave-matthews',
            name: 'Dave Matthews',
          },
          'userToken',
        );
        setClientReady(true);
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
      }
    };

    setupClient();
  }, [chatClient, userToken]);

  if (!clientReady) return null;

  return (
    <Chat client={chatClient}>
      <ChannelList filters={filters} sort={sort} options={options} />
      <Channel>
        <Window>
          <ChannelHeader />
          <MessageList />
          <MessageInput />
        </Window>
        <Thread />
      </Channel>
    </Chat>
  );
};

export default App;
```
