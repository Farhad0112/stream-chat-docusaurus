starting point and you can follow along in your code editor.

## Your First App with Stream Chat and Angular

The below example is all the code you need to launch a fully functioning chat experience.

### Import the StreamChatModule module

Import the `StreamChatModule` which contains all the necessary services and components

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, StreamChatAngularModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Initialization

You will need the following init steps to connect to the chat client with a user, open WebSocket connection and load the user's channels:

```typescript
this.chatService.init(
  environment.apiKey,
  environment.userId,
  environment.userToken
);
void this.channelService.init();
```

### UI components

The following code will create the chat UI

```html
<div id="root">
  <stream-channel-list></stream-channel-list>
  <div class="str-chat str-chat-channel messaging light">
    <div class="str-chat__container">
      <div class="str-chat__main-panel">
        <stream-channel-header></stream-channel-header>
        <stream-channel></stream-channel>
        <stream-message-input></stream-message-input>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
