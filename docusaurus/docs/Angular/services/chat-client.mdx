The `ChatClient` service connects the user to the Stream chat.

# Overview

## chatClient

The [StreamChat client](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/client.ts) instance. In general you shouldn't need to access the client, but it's there if you want to use it.

## init

Creates a [`StreamChat`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/668b3e5521339f4e14fc657834531b4c8bf8176b/src/client.ts#L124) instance using the provided `apiKey`, and connects a user with the given `userId` and `userToken`. More info about [connecting users](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/init_and_users/?language=javascript) can be found in the platform documentation.

:::important
Calling the `init` method creates a new [WebSocket connection](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/init_and_users/?language=javascript#websocket-connections), you should only call it once.
:::

## notification$

Emits [`Notification`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-angular/blob/master/projects/stream-chat-angular/src/lib/chat-client.service.ts) events. The platform documentation covers [the list of client and notification events](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/event_object/?language=javascript).

:::important
For performance reasons this Observable operates outside of the Angular change detection zone. If you subscribe to it, you need to manually reenter Angular's change detection zone, our [Change detection guide](../concepts/change-detection.mdx) explains this in detail.
:::

## connectionState$

Emits the current connection state of the user (`online` or `offline`)

## flagMessage

Flag the message with the given ID. If you want to know [more about flags](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/moderation/?language=javascript) check out the platform documentation.

## autcompleteUsers

Returns the autocomplete options for application users, sends a [search request](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/javascript/query_users/?language=javascript#querying-using-the-$autocomplete-operator) with the given search term.
